I am not going to pretend that I am a coder wiz. I am just a normal software guy, who has written these codes for my own personal use. I know there are intelligent and smart people out there, who can not only write better code but also develop better algos. In case some people find something valuable here, you can pick up and honour the license under which the code is released.

This repo is strictly as-is. Please do not come to me for changes and modifications. The source is licensed under GNU GPL, so please go ahead.
Also, I am not responsible for any trading/investing/financial loss that you encounter after using these codes. Please do your own analysis.
